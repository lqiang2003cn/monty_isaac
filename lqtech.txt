now, the dom is ok, i want to embrace docker, all in docker.
Here is my vision:
1. a dynamic architecture using docker, each component is a docker image
2. each component communicate using  various protocols: ros2 bridge, zmq etc as needed
3. for now, i have to components: isaac_comp and ros2_comp and ros2_comp, they communicate using ros2 bridge
4. use docker compose to configure running instances of the system.
